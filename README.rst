Fubsy: The Universal Build Tool
===============================

Fubsy is a tool for efficiently building software. If you need to
minimally rebuild a bunch of target files from a bunch of source files
by following a bunch of rules, Fubsy is what you need. If you prefer a
more formal, abstract description: Fubsy is an engine for conditional
execution of actions based on the dependencies between related
resources.

Building
--------

Fubsy is written in Go, and uses the gc compiler to build. If you're
on Unix, you already have Go installed, and you don't care about
satisfying Fubsy's optional dependencies, just run ::

    ./configure.sh && ./build.sh

For more information, see ``doc/build.txt``.

Using
-----

See the user guide in ``doc/guide`` (online at http://fubsy.readthedocs.org/).

Currently, Fubsy is in the very early stages of development. You can
write tiny toy build scripts with it, but there is a lot of work to do
before it's ready for the real world.

Contributing
------------

The main purpose of this release is to attract developers who want to
help shape Fubsy into a world-class build tool. Please see
http://fubsy.gerg.ca/develop/ for more information.

Mailing list
------------

Currently there is only one mailing list: fubsydev@librelist.org. Send
an empty message to that address and you'll be subscribed. Then help
us make Fubsy the best it can be!
