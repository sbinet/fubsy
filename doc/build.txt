Building Fubsy from Source
==========================

I'm not currently distributing Fubsy binaries -- so if you want to
give it a try, you'll have to build it from source. The same procedure
applies whether you are building in a Mercurial working dir or from a
release tarball.

Requirements
------------

Fubsy is written in Go and (optionally) uses Kyoto Cabinet for
persistent storage [1]. Thus:

  * you must have Go 1.0.x installed

  * you should have Kyoto Cabinet (including headers and development
    library) installed

Details follow.

.. [1] If you build on a system without Kyoto Cabinet, the resulting
       Fubsy binary will work, but it will be incapable of incremental
       builds. Fubsy requires persistent storage for incremental
       builds to work, and the only storage backend supported so far
       is Kyoto Cabinet. (More coming in future.)

Installing Go
-------------

If you are already able to build and run Go programs, skip to the next
section. Fubsy has no exotic requirements in this regard.

If you are running recent versions of Debian (>= 7.0 aka wheezy) or
Ubuntu (>= 12.10 aka quantal), try installing the OS package::

    sudo apt-get install golang

On Mac OS X with MacPorts, try (untested!) ::

    sudo port install go

On Mac OS X with Homebrew, try (untested!) ::

    brew install go

If you are running any other Unix/Linux variant (including Mac OS X):

  #. download the appropriate binary tarball for your platform from
     `the Go project downloads page
     <http://code.google.com/p/go/downloads/list>`_

  #. unpack it to a dedicated directory, e.g. ::

       cd /usr/local
       rm -rf go
       tar -xzf go1.0.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz   # filename may differ!

  #. make sure your shell can find the ``go`` command, e.g. by adding
     ``/usr/local/go/bin`` to your ``$PATH``

If you are on Windows: see Go's `Getting Started
<http://golang.org/doc/install>`_ page, and good luck! While I do
intend for Windows to be a fully-supported first-class platform for
Fubsy, it isn't yet. Have patience, be prepared for things to break,
and *please* send patches if you can fix them!

Third-party Go libraries
------------------------

Fubsy depends on several third-party Go libraries, but they are all
included in the source repository. There's nothing to do here.

Installing Kyoto Cabinet
------------------------

Remember: this is an optional dependency. If you can't get it to work,
just skip it. You'll get a Fubsy binary that is incapable of
incremental builds, but you should still be able to get a taste for
how Fubsy works.

On Debian/Ubuntu, try ::

    sudo apt-get install libkyotocabinet-dev

On Fedora/Red Hat, try (untested!) ::

    sudo yum install kyotocabinet-devel

On Mac OS X with MacPorts, try (untested!) ::

    sudo port install kyotocabinet

On Mac OS X with Homebrew, try (untested!) ::

    brew install kyoto-cabinet

Otherwise, try searching your OS' native package manager. Make sure
you install the "dev" or "devel" package (if any); Fubsy requires the
Kyoto Cabinet header files to build.

If your OS doesn't package Kyoto Cabinet, or you are using an OS
without a package manager, the source is here:
http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/pkg/ .

Building
--------

To build Fubsy and run all unit tests (Unix only)::

    ./build.sh

Obviously this won't work on Windows, and I haven't written an
equivalent batch file yet. Patches are welcome!

To prove that Fubsy can build itself using its own build script:

    ./bin/fubsy

(If that fails because you don't have Kyoto Cabinet installed, you'll
have to edit ``main.fubsy``. Fubsy doesn't have a auto-configuration
feature yet, although it's in the plan.)
